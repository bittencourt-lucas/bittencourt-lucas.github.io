        <h2>
            Creating CSS3 Transitions and Animations in CSS and
            triggering them with JavaScript
        </h2>
        <p>
            CSS3 has brought a lot of interesting effects that can be used
            to create animations in a website. This week there's a brief
            introduction to the Transitions and the Animations using CSS3
            and how to trigger these effects with JavaScript. Later on,
            there will be weeks that focus specifically in Transitions,
            Transformations, and Animations.
        </p>
        <p style="color:red;">
            CSS3 may not be compatible with older browsers, or require specific
            prefixes to create compatibility. Internet Explorer 9 and earlier
            versions aren't compatible at all.
        </p>
        <li>
            By using features such as HTML and CSS DOM, along with Animations
            and Transitions from CSS3, it's possible to create neat effects
            that impress users:
        </li>
        <p><button onclick="magicTransition()">Click me</button></p>
        <div class="information" id="magicTransition">
            My name is Lucas Bittencourt. Send me a message at
            bit16005@byui.edu!
        </div>
        <p><button onclick="playAnimation()">Click me</button></p>
        <span id="circle1"></span>
        <span id="circle2"></span>
        <span id="circle3"></span>
        <span id="circle4"></span>
        <span id="circle5"></span>
