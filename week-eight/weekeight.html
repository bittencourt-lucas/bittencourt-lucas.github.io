        <h1>Week Eight</h1>
        <h2>
            Designing, Defining, and Triggering CSS3 Transitions without Custom Libraries (Thought Library)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Transitions have four properties that can be changed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>transition-property: Which CSS property will be affected.</li>
          <li>transition-duration: How long the transition will last.</li>
          <li>transition-timing-function: The timing function of the transition.</li>
          <li>transition-delay: How long until the transition starts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It's possible to edit more than one transition property at the same CSS line!
        </p>
        <div class="box"></div>
        <p>
          There are different timing functions. By the way, there's a 1 second delay before the transition starts,
          so hold your mouse hovering!
        </p>
        <li>Ease</li>
        <div class="rectangle one"></div>
        <li>Ease In</li>
        <div class="rectangle two"></div>
        <li>Ease Out</li>
        <div class="rectangle three"></div>
        <li>Ease In-Out</li>
        <div class="rectangle four"></div>
        <li>Linear</li>
        <div class="rectangle five"></div>
        <h2>
            Mobile Devices ( Ex. onTouchBegin, onLoad, etc.) and Animation and Transition Events
        </h2>
        <p>
            To use the features on this part, you'll need to simulate a Mobile Device, or access
            this page on an actual Mobile Device.
        </p>
        <div ontouchstart="touchBox()" ontouchend="releaseBox()" id="mobilebox"></div>
        <p>
          The box above has an onTouchStart and an onTouchEnd event. So when the box is
          being held with a finger, it'll start changing its color to blue, and when it's released,
          it'll change back to red.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you probably noticed already, the page also has an onLoad event attached to the body
          of the page, so it'll display whenever the page is reloaded.
        </p>
